                <p><strong>What is TB?</strong></p>
                <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs but can spread to other organs.</p>
                <p><strong>Importance of Effective Solutions</strong></p>
                <p>TB is a major global health problem. Effective solutions are necessary to treat and control its spread.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Patients take their medication under the supervision of a healthcare worker.</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Moderate cost due to the need for healthcare workers.</p>
                <p><strong>Availability of Materials:</strong> Medications are generally available, but the need for healthcare staff can be a limitation.</p>
                <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> High, as it ensures adherence to the treatment regimen.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A vaccine derived from a strain of Mycobacterium bovis, primarily used in countries with high TB prevalence.</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Low to moderate.</p>
                <p><strong>Availability of Materials:</strong> Widely available as it is part of many national immunization programs.</p>
                <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Variable, more effective in preventing severe forms of TB in children.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p><strong>Cost Comparison:</strong> DOT is more expensive due to labor costs, while the BCG vaccine is relatively cheaper.</p>
                <p><strong>Material Availability Comparison:</strong> The BCG vaccine is more readily available globally compared to the logistical requirements of DOT.</p>
                <p><strong>Overall Effectiveness:</strong> DOT is highly effective for treatment adherence; the BCG vaccine is more preventive, especially in children.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Both solutions play crucial roles in the fight against TB. For immediate treatment and ensuring patient compliance, DOT is more effective. For long-term prevention, especially in high TB burden areas, the BCG vaccine is a vital tool. The choice between the two solutions depends on the specific needs and resources of the region in question.</p>
